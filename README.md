# jet::live
**jet::live** is a library to perform c++ "hot code reload" on the fly. It works on linux on 64 bit systems powered by x86-64 cpus. 
Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with clang 6.0.1/7.0.1, cmake 3.10.2, ninja 1.8.2/make 4.1 on linux and TBD on macos.
If you need something similar for windows, please try [blink](https://github.com/crosire/blink), [live++](https://molecular-matters.com/products_livepp.html) or something else, I have no plans to support windows.
\* macos port is not completed yet, will be ready in a couple of weeks or so
